# Red Wine Quality Prediction
The global wine market expanded from $339.53 billion in 2020 to $340.23 billion in 2021 and is anticipated to reach $456.76 billion by 2028, growing at a steady annual rate of 4.30%.(Source:https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/press-release/wine-market-9963). Quality assessment is crucial for maintaining consumer satisfaction and brand reputation, yet it remains a challenging and subjective task due to the complexity of wine's chemical composition. 

In this project, a dataset containing attributes related to the physicochemical properties and sensory evaluations of red wine will be analyzed. The goal of this project is to predict the quality of red wwine variants of Portuguese "Vinho Verde" using physicochemical and sensory variables. This project aims to develop our skills in classification  task, data preprocessing and predictive modeling. The primary objectives are to build a predictive model to estimate wine quality based on these physicochemical tests, identify and analyze the variables that most significantly influence wine quality, and provide suggestions and recommendations to firms based on our analysis and findings.


The Red Wine Quality Prediction dataset includes the following features:

Fixed Acidity: Tartaric acid, typically the primary component of acidity in wine.

Volatile Acidity: Acetic acid in wine, which at too high levels can lead to an unpleasant, vinegar taste.

Citric Acid: Adds 'freshness' and flavor to the wine.

Residual Sugar: The amount of sugar remaining after the fermentation process.

Chlorides: The amount of salt in the wine.

Free Sulfur Dioxide: SO2 in its free form is able to prevent microbial growth and the oxidation of wine.

Total Sulfur Dioxide: The sum of free and bound forms of SO2; a measure of overall sulfur dioxide content.

pH: How acidic or basic the wine is.

Sulphates: A wine additive which can contribute to sulfur dioxide gas (SO2) levels, acts as an antimicrobial and antioxidant.

Alcohol: The alcohol content in wine.

Density: Measure of how "heavy" the wine is for its size, which is affected by alcohol and sugar content.

Our target variable is called Quality: A score assigned by wine tasters to the wine (ranging from 3 to 8).
